= Introduction =
Clock faces control how visitors to your web page see your clock. There are current two types of clock faces that are natively supported: *text* and *image*. 

== Text Faces ==
When creating a clock, the "Text Face" is the default used, and the time will be displayed in the following format:
{{{
hh:mm:ss
}}}
If you want to change something about a text face, such as the separation character (in this case, the colon "*:*"), simple pass in the following:
{{{
epiClock.set({
    id: 'curtime',
    face: new face({sep: '-'}),
    });
}}}
This will create a string clock that will format your time:
{{{
hh-mm-ss
}}}

== Image Faces ==
One of the nice features of the epiClock is the ability for users to create their own animated or static image clocks. For more info on making your own clock, check out the [user_image Image Clock Guide]. Here, we will just go over setting up a flip-clock. The flip clock is an image clock which uses the custom images included with the clock to simulate an old 1980s-ish alarm clock.

Creating a flip clock is as simple as passing in *new flip()* as your face parameter when creating a new clock.
{{{
epiClock.set({
    id: 'curtime',
    face: new flip(),
    });
}}}
This will turn your clock into a simple flip clock with no other arguments needed. Awesome.
