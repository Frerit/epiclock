= Introduction =
When setting a timer, you must provide the life of the timer. Take a look at the following code, which will create simple epiClock timer:
{{{
epiClock.set({
    id: 'timerdiv',
    model: 'O',
    timer: {secs: 30, mins: 3},
    face: new flip(),
    });
}}}

The *timer object* is this bit here:
{{{
   ...
   timer: {secs: 30, mins: 3}
   ...
}}}

The timer that we create here will run for 3 mins and 30 seconds, then expire. A timer object can have any of the following settings:

|| *Name* || *Description* ||
|| years || Sets the number of years before the timer expires. Because a timer starts when the page loads, offsetting by years is *not recommended!* ||
|| days || Sets the number of days before the timer expires. Because a timer starts when the page loads, offsetting by days is *not recommended!*  ||
|| hours || Sets the number of hours before a timer expires. Because a timer starts when the page loads, offsetting by hours is _usually_ *not recommended!* ||
|| mins || Sets the number of minutes before a timer expires. ||
|| secs || Sets the number of seconds before a timer expires. ||
