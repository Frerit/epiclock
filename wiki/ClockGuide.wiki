#labels Phase-Support

= Introduction =

The epiclock plugin supports a number of different modes and configurations. These are passed into epiclock in the following format:

{{{
    jQuery('#some-element').epiclock({ /* Options */ });
}}}

= Available Options =

|| *Option* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| mode || string || The [ClockModes clock mode] describes what type of clock should be rendered. ||
|| offset || object || An object containing offset values for displacing the computed time of the clock. ||
|| startpaused || boolean || Flag which, if true, will start the clock off as paused. Default is false. ||
|| utc || boolean || Flag to determine if the clock should be set to UTC mode. Default is false. ||
|| gmt || boolean || Alias of utc ||
|| render || function || Callback function for rendering the clock ticks. ||
|| tare || boolean || Flag to determine if the clock should tare (reset) on pause. Default is false ||
|| format || string || A formatting string, as described in the [RenderingGuide Rendering Guide] ||
|| time || datestring || A string to pass to the JS Date object. Used in some modes. ||
|| target || datestring || Alias of time ||
|| displayOffset || object || An object containing offset values for displacing the years/days of a clock ||



= Clock Events =

The epiclock plugin will dispatch different events through the object which is acting as the clock container. You can bind listeners for these events using the standard jQuery syntax of:

{{{
    jQuery('#some-element').epiclock({ /* Options */ }).bind(eventType, listenerFunction);
}}}

*Note*: Unlike the standard jQuery object notification, the `this` pointer of listener functions will point to the epiclock object definition.

Available events are:

|| *Event Type* || *Description* ||
|| timer || Triggered whenever a timer completes. Only dispatched on timer type clocks (rollover, expire, loop, timer) ||
|| rendered || Triggered whenever the value of a clocks changes, at a latency of once per 500 seconds (configurable) ||
|| pause || Triggered whenever the clock is paused. ||
|| resume || Triggered whenever a paused clock is resumed. ||
|| destroy || Triggered whenever a clock is destroyed. ||
