= Introduction =
Clock formats determine how the time the epiClock calculates is displayed. At this point, the format is limited to the following:

|| *Format* || *Format Code* || *Description* ||
|| Meridian Time || M || A 12 hour day, either Ante or Post Meridian. 13:00 hours would be displayed as 1:00 PM ||
|| Military Time || I || A 24 hour day. 1:00 PM would be displayed as 13:00 hours ||

= Use Case =
In the following simple clock, we'll display the time in 24 hour (military) format:
{{{
epiClock.set('curtime', {
    format: 'I'
    });
}}}
