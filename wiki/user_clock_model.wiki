= Introduction =
Clock models determine what the epiClock will create. There are three types of models available: *clocks, timers,* and *counters*.

|| *Model* || *Model Code* || Model Type || *Description* ||
|| Clock || C || CLOCK || Displays a clock that displays the current time, with any user provided offsets. ||
|| Countdown Counter || D || COUNTER || Sets the counter to count down to a provided target date, expiring when the date passes. ||
|| Countup Counter || U || COUNTER || Sets the counter to count up from a provided target date. ||
|| Rollover Counter || DU || COUNTER || Sets the counter to count down to a provided target date. When the date passes, the clock will become a *Countup Counter* instead of expiring. ||
|| One-Shot Timer || O || TIMER || Sets the timer to count down a certain amount of time, starting at page load. (ex. A 5 second timer will expire 5 seconds after page load.) ||
|| Looping Timer || T || TIMER || Sets the timer to count down a certain amount of time, starting at page load. When the timer runs out, instead of expiring, it will start again, counting down the same amount of time. ||
|| Stopwatch || S || COUNTER || Sets a stopwatch to count up seconds, starting at page load. This clock never computes it's value against the current time, and only uses the *displace* property of a clock to calculate the time. ||
