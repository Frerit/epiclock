= Introduction =
Each epiClock Face can be one of the following types. To set an epiClock Face to one of the provided types, pass in `{type: '<Type Code>'}` as part of the settings argument when creating a [dev_obj_face Face Object].

|| *Type* || *Type Code* || *Description* ||
|| String || str || A clock face which renders the calculated time as a string of text. ||
|| Image || img || A clock face which renders the calculated time as a group of images. ||

== Special Case (Flip Clock) ==
Normally, when creating a [dev_obj_face Face] for a [dev_obj_clock Clock Object], using the default flip clock, we do the following:
{{{
{face: new face({type: 'img', pre: ['s','d','df'], dir:'epiClock/flip', ...})}
}}}
However, since v1.0 of the clock, there exists a short cut helper method to create flip clock. Just pass in:
{{{
{face: new flip()}
}}}
Which has all of the settings pre filled to generate a flip clock for you.
