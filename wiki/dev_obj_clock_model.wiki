Each epiClock can be one of the following types of models. To set an epiClock to one of the provided models, pass in {model: '*<Model Code>*'} as part of the settings argument.

|| *Model* || *Model Code* || *Description* ||
|| Clock || C || Displays a clock that displays the current time, with any user provided offsets. ||
|| Countdown Counter || D || Sets the counter to count down to a provided target date, expiring when the date passes. ||
|| Countup Counter || U || Sets the counter to count up from a provided target date. ||
|| Rollover Counter || DU || Sets the counter to count down to a provided target date. When the date passes, the clock will become a *Countup Counter* instead of expiring. ||
|| One-Shot Timer || O || Sets the timer to count down a certain amount of time, starting at page load. (ex. A 5 second timer will expire 5 seconds after page load.) ||
|| Looping Timer || T || Sets the timer to count down a certain amount of time, starting at page load. When the timer runs out, instead of expiring, it will start again, counting down the same amount of time. ||
