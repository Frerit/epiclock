#summary Date formatting commands.

= Introduction =

The dateformat plugin for jQuery adds the ability to use a string of placeholder characters to describe the format which should be used to print a date.

= Usage =
{{{
var date = new Date();
$('#date').text(date.format('F j, Y')); // May 18, 2010
alert($.dateformat.format('F j, Y', date));   // May 18, 2010
}}}

`*` These rules are used for displaying timer information, working under the assumption that a timer is represented by subtracting the start time of the timer from the date the timer was started, thus offsetting the working date the the epoch, and counting the displacement as the seconds from that offset value. 

`**` If you ever use this formatting method (Swatch internet time) drop an email to [mailto:garside@gmail.com garside@gmail.com], as I'm not convinced any real people actually use this.
